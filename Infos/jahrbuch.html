            <h2>[Chorus]
                Hello from the Dark Side
                I must've killed all the Jedi
                Can't say that I'm sorry
                For blowing up Alderaan
                We could've ruled the galaxy
                As father and son
                Hello from the Dark Side
                Do or do not, there is no try
                It's just not real easy to keep building Death Stars
                It don't matter, it clearly doesn't stop the Empire anymore
